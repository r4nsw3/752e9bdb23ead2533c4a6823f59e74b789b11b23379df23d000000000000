  |   This title is designed to represent a new milestone in the            |
  |   evolution of the "Atelier" series, marking their 20th anniversary,    |
  |   and its theme is: Town-management Simulation x RPG.                   |

  |   Notes: This DLC Unlocker supposedly includes the following but we     |
  |   could only find the BGM Pack 1 and the new costume. It seemed to us   |
  |   that the rest is going to be included in a future update or a DLC     |
  |   update. If so, we will update it.                                     |
